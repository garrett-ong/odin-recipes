    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tamagoyaki is a rolled egg omelette flavored with soy sauce, sugar, and dashi. It is commonly served with rice.
        I also like to eat it with furikake or nori.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Instant dashi granules</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce (Usukuchi Shoyu)</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add light soy sauce, sugar, and instant dashi granules into a small bowl. Mix until dashi and sugar are dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add eggs to bowl with dashi mixture. Beat eggs until no streaks remain.</li>
        <li>Cook egg mixture in a pan over medium heat with oil. Roll into an omelette shape as you cook. Note: This is not easy and you will probably make
            scrambled eggs the first couple of times. It will still taste good.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with rice, furikake, and nori.</li>
    </ol>
