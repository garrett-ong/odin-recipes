This project is a basic recipes website.
It will contain some basic recipes and will be a demonstration of HTML usage.

I will put into practice the skills I have learned so far in HTML in the Odin project, including:

index page, links, headers, paragraphs, lists

(This readme was written before starting the project. After finishing, I will write a reflection below.)
